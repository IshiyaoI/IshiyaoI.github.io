# About me

I am an undergraduate student at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I'm interested in deep learning and its application to CV and AI4science. I am also a developer of augmented reality technology, and I designed and manufactured an augmented reality device by myself (which is my graduation project). I was a research intern at Oneflow Inc. and Chinese Academy of Sciences.
