# About me
I am currently a PhD student at HKUST(GZ) under the supervision of Prof.Yuyu Luo and Prof.Nan Tang. I'm interested in augmented reality and its application to data analysis. I am also a developer of computer vision projects, and I designed and manufactured an augmented reality device by myself (which is my graduation project).
